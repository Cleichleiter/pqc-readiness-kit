Documentation Overview



This directory contains supporting documentation for the pqc-readiness-kit. Each document serves a specific purpose and is intended to be read independently or as part of a sequence.



Documents

Methodology



File: methodology.md



Describes how cryptographic data is collected, which system sources are used, and how inventory data should be interpreted. This document focuses on collection accuracy, limitations, and design intent.



Threat Model



File: threat-model.md



Defines the threat assumptions and risk framing used by the toolkit. It clarifies which risks are in scope (such as harvest-now-decrypt-later) and which are explicitly out of scope.



PQC Readiness Playbook



File: pqc-readiness-playbook.md



Provides practical guidance for turning inventory findings into remediation actions and longer-term planning steps. This document focuses on hygiene, dependency mapping, and algorithm agility preparation.



Intended Audience



These documents are written for:



Security engineers



Infrastructure and platform teams



Architects and technical leadership



Risk and compliance stakeholders



They are intentionally conservative, vendor-agnostic, and focused on preparation rather than implementation.



How to Use This Documentation



Start with Methodology to understand what the data represents.



Review the Threat Model to align expectations and scope.
